# HostsGenerator
Uses DuckDuckGo and Wolfram|Alpha APIs to find many subdomains under a user-supplied domain name, and creates a Windows hosts file for mass-blocking of said domains.

Required libraries to build:
  commons-logging-1.2.jar
  httpcore-4.0.1.jar
  httpclient-4.0.1.jar
  commons-codec-1.3.jar
  jsoup-1.13.1.jar
